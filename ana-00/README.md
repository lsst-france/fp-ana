we want to associate star positions from ``CFHT`` data:

```
/sps/lsst/data/astrometry_net_data/CFHT-Deep/
/sps/lsst/data/astrometry_net_data/sdss-dr9-raw/sdss-dr9-fink-v5b/
```

to star positions obtained with ``LSST`` software stack:

```
/sps/lsst/data/DC2014/CFHTLS/output/coadd_r_dir/deepCoadd/
```
